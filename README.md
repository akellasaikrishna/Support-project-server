# aws-chat-server

### Dependencies required ###

1. Node.js
2. Git
3. Nodemon (local dev purposes)

### Steps to run the server ###

1. Install Node globally in the local machine. After installing node, globally install Nodemon using "npm install -g Nodemon" command.
2. Clone the repo into the local machine.
3. Inside the cloned repo folder, hit "npm install" to install all the required dependencies and packages.
4. Now in the same directory, open command prompt (or) shell and run "nodemon server.js".
5. By default, the server will be running on port 4000. If you want to change it, you can do so in the server.js file.

### Benefits of using Nodemon over Node to run the server ###

1. No need to re-run the server by killing it for every change.
2. Changes are seamless and will reflect in the server once files are saved.
